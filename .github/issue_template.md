## ðŸŒ± New Theme?

As much as the team is responsible for the core theme and wants to support all available applications, we can only do some of it ourselves.

That's why the community is essential for this project to keep evolving. ðŸŒ±

Our website has some guidelines, tips and specifications for those who want to apply the theme in any application.

## ðŸŒ² Existing Theme?

Find the appropriate repository on the [Dracula organization](https://github.com/dracula).

This is just the umbrella place where we store all themes.

And remember - consider fixing the issue yourself. That's the best way to contribute. ðŸ˜‰
